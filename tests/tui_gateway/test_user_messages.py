"""User-facing copy for assistant-start failures must match the failure's actual cause.

When init dies waiting for a cross-process auth lock — the profile auth-store lock or the shared
PULSE store lock, both on the ``resolve_pulse_access_token`` init path (#124533) — the cause is
contention with another pulse process (a dashboard or a slow credential refresh), so the generic
/model / `pulse setup` hints would send the user re-checking credentials that are fine.
